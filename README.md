This repository contains a VBScript code example demonstrating a type mismatch error that can occur when comparing numbers with null or empty strings in an If statement.  The error arises from VBScript's implicit type conversion. The solution demonstrates how to handle such situations by explicitly checking for null or empty strings before comparison and handling them appropriately.
